# Life Expectancy and GDP
## Overview:
The project involved analyzing the trends in life expectancy and GDP of six countries from the year 2000 to 2015. The data used for this analysis was already clean and didn't require preparation. The main objectives were to visualize the trends using Python libraries (Matplotlib and Seaborn), examine relationships between variables, and calculate key statistics to gain insights into the data.

In this project, we will visualize data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

The dataset is saved as a csv file named 'all_data.csv'. The data includes:

    Country: the name of the nation
    Year: the year the data was taken
    life expectancy at birth (years): the amount of years a person can expect to live in years
    GDP: the gross domestic product of the nation

## Steps Taken:

1. Data Inspection:
    - Checked for missing observations, which revealed no missing data in the dataset.

2. Data Visualization:
    - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create line graphs and scatter plots.
    - Visualized the trends in life expectancy and GDP over the period 2000 to 2015.
    - Examined the relationships between life expectancy and GDP for the six countries.

3. Analysis Findings:
    - Observed an overall increase in life expectancy and GDP in all six countries during the considered period.
    - Calculated the average life expectancy by country and year to quantify the improvements.
    - Identified Zimbabwe as an outlier with a significant increase in life expectancy over the years.
    - Highlighted Zimbabwe's low GDP compared to other nations during the analysis period.

4. Key Insights:
    - Average life expectancy of the six countries increased from 70.8 in 2000 to 75.7 in 2015.
    - Zimbabwe experienced a notable increase in life expectancy from about 45 years to over 60 years, representing a 25% improvement.
    - USA remained the top GDP country throughout the 15-year period, while China overtook Germany to become the second-largest economy.

5. Relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy:
    - The scatterplots revealed a positive relationship between GDP and life expectancy for all countries considered.
    - The calculated correlation coefficient of 0.34 supported the existence of this positive correlation.

## Conclusion:
The project demonstrated significant improvements in life expectancy and GDP for the six countries from 2000 to 2015. Zimbabwe's exceptional increase in life expectancy and its low GDP were noteworthy findings. The positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy further emphasized the importance of economic growth in improving healthcare and life quality.
